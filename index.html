            <p style="color:rgb(253, 150, 79)"> The story is set in Tokyo, where an old school right in between the neighborhoods of
Akihabara, <br>Kanda and Jinbocho is in danger of consolidation and closure.

Nine girls, centering Honoka Kosaka, <br> have stepped up 
to defy the imminent danger facing their school. <br>

“If we want to protect  <br>our beloved school, we need to do what we can? 
we need to become idols!”
Hoping against hope there’s  <br>something they can do about this, 
the girls strive to become famous, <br>
spread the word about their school, <br> attract more students, and save the day.

Now their “School Idol Project” begins  <br>to make their dreams come true!
“Make our dreams come true!”
            </p>
